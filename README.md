# BedSpace - lay-down VR space sim game

### Ideas

* Procedurally generate new systems
* Collect enough energy to initiate a "jump", and choose from 2-3 exit points
* If your ship explodes, it becomes collectable parts/energy for future travelers
* Allow adding curated scenes for special events, inserted at particular sequence points
* Basic AI can try to follow your ship and attack / collide with it (e.g. proximity mines)
